# Solar-Panel-Model
A solar panel model simulating a real life case of solar panel installation, based on user input parameters.
A program made on the software "labVIEW" which is a basic interactive coding language.
This program offers you the choice in choosing the right solar panels types as well as battery types while offering the advantages and disadvantages of each type.
The program would then give the best choice for an inverter.
The user is then asked to provide some information related to his case (i.e maximum load, monthly energy consumption, location index, season and more)
Given this information, the program would provide calculation of several factors (eg, the DOD factor, the CRT meter,...)
The program would then start a simulation for one day on the charging and discharging of the batteries
If any errors are detected (eg. the inverter does not support a certain load) the program would jump to a maintenance state where messages are prompted for the user giving directions to fix the problem.

This program is helpful, easy to use and recommended.
